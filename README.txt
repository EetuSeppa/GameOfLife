# GameOfLife
Conway's Game of life in C using Raylib

Run program with name of .rle file (without header lines) as an argument to open the file in program.
Basic usage:
  Right-click: insert cells when in insert mode
  Left-click and drag: pan in world
  Mouse-wheel: zoom
  G-key: toggle grid
  C-key and left-click drag: copy area
  V-key and left-click: paste selected area
  Space: exit insert mode and start simulation
  
Improvements to be made:
  -Zooming needs to pan in relation to mouse position
  -Algorithm for finding if coordinate is already to be tested needs to be improved
  -Code readability has to be improved
